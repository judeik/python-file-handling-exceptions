File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment
Author: Ojobor Jude Ikechukwu

Description:
------------
This program demonstrates:
1. File Reading & Writing
2. Error Handling with try-except blocks
3. Clean and robust Python coding practices

Tasks:
üñãÔ∏è File Read & Write Challenge:
   - Reads the content of a file
   - Writes a modified version of the content into a new file

üß™ Error Handling Lab:
   - Asks the user for a filename
   - Handles errors if the file doesn‚Äôt exist or cannot be read
